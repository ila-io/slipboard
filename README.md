# slipboard
I designed this macropad to slip onto the top of my Surface Pro, since I like to take the keyboard off to draw and watch media in tablet mode, but I also like to be able to copy and paste, undo, and the like. The pen buttons are extremely unhelpful in their utility to say the least, so I created a macropad! As of now, the button layout is as such: 

| undo | copy | paste | delete |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ------ | 

The encoder press is used to pause/play music, and as of now it's rotation just bound to f13/f14, which I'm hoping to make change my pen size in Krita!  (I'm also hoping to be able to hold down and turn the encoder to switch between profiles, but that's a problem for once I get it built lol) 

## CAD
Here's the slipboard slipped onto a mockup section of the Surface Pro!

I plan to add rubber/silicon to the insets that you can see beneath the tablet, since I own some that I could cut out and glue in myself!  

### back/bottom

## PCB/Schematic
I'm a big fan of the look of the raw traces on the PCB, so I utilized that and the silkscreen to make a design that will show through on the backside of the slipboard when its on my tablet!
